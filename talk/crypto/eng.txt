september 1945 the end of the second world war

soviet nha doc tai joseph stalin bo nhiem

georgio desh as the head of the

dang cong san of one of his vessel states

he was later soai ngoi by dictator josh esco

these dictators pham nhung toi khung khiep
to humankind they put people in

jail for no reason they tortured and

killed thousands of people
=============================
from some families

they took away everything they had and

they ousted these families from the country

one of these families was mine my great

grandmother and my great grandfather

by this time you probably think you're

in the wrong talk what does all of this have to do

with blockchain because blockchain is

that thing about crypto and bitcoin

isn't it

yes it is
but
===========================================

that's not all of it and that's why i'm

here today i want to show you another

site about blockchain

that usually we don't consider so much

because blockchain could have avoided

and prevented some of the kho khan va dau kho
that my family had to endure

during that dictatorship

in one sweep

the dictator took away everything that

my family had been building

for decades and generations

the communist party by force took away

the factory they owned and where they

employed a lot of workers

and the house where they had been raised

from one day to the next the dictator

declared that this land shall now belong

to him and his cronies and not to us

anymore and he could do that because he

had absolute control over the

centralized land registry in that

country

so his will was the law and this is

where blockchain comes in

a blockchain is a public and

phi tap chung database a ledger

and with that su phi tap chung in mind

we could have decentralized and

distributed the so dang ki dat dai to many

computers all over the country and even

the world

so no single malign actor or party
could have manipulated that system

anymore

and that is why to me blockchain is such

a strong tool

of democracy

so if people ask me blockchain that's

about crypto

and bitcoin

to me blockchain is about freedom

this is moria a huge refugee camp on the

greek island of lesbos where thousands

of refugees are being kept in inhumane

conditions

doctors without borders even called it

the worst refugee camp on earth

the problem is that as a refugee

you can't really escape from these camps

if you cannot prove

your identity

and how do you prove that you are who

you are without a passport

and so many times

these refugees have been taken away

their passports by the very regimes they

fled from

or by the traffickers

they trusted

imagine if we had a digital a

decentralized identity

based on our biometric data

that nobody can take away from us

no regime no dictator no trafficker

this is again where blockchain can help

us

with blockchain we can create this

and this is again why for me blockchain

is about freedom

a few years ago i lived in singapore to

found my first startup

when i first moved there i got invited

to the house of a friend over for dinner

and in the trong suot buoi toi i

noticed a small side room ben canh (just off) the

main living room

what i thought was a small storage

cabinet was in reality the room would

have made the housekeeper lived and

slept a tiny room without windows

her name was maria and she was an

immigrant worker from the philippines

she had moved to singapore to earn some

money to support her family back home in

the philippines

whenever maria wanted to send her money

to her family she had to go through

various intermediaries

each and every one of them

such as banks money agencies and so on

each and every one of them taking a cut

of her hard-earned

money

so in the end once the money arrived

with her family days sometimes weeks

later only a fraction of what maria had

sent would actually arrive

the whole situation is aggravated by the

fact that in many rural countries and

many rural developing countries people

don't even have access to basic

financial infrastructure

what i mean is they don't even have a

bank account

so how to even send them money

again this is where blockchain comes in

with blockchain maria can send directly

from her cell phone in singapore to her

son's cell phone in the philippines the

hard-earned money

directly instantly

and at

quasi-zero cost

that way maria can spend more time with

her family and has to look has has to

work

less

again blockchain is about freedom

now you might say well that's all nice

but the philippines are far away and so

is singapore how does that concern us

we're in a safe place like austria and

indeed we were lucky that we were born

here in a prosperous and cozy country

where we have access to clean water to

food to a pension system to social

security

to bank bank accounts and so on

but we have to realize that not

everybody was born that lucky and that

we are not the norm

we are rather the exception not them and

that is why we have a moral obligation

to help them

this looks a bit like a note from the

board game monopoly but it's actually

the currency of venezuela in this case

in the denomination of 500 million

bolivar

the problem with with this bill is that

you can barely buy a loaf of bread with

it

this is the product of the country's

hyperinflation

that has been there for years

and it's been it's become so bad that if

you go to work in the morning the money

you earn by the time you get home on the

same day that money will be worthless

what has happened here again a central

party has abused its power

somebody printed money flooded the

market with money created hyperinflation

and by that created poverty and

devastation in the country so that many

people had to leave the country for

economic reasons

again blockchain could help us

blockchain could decentralize away the

power from one single

central institution in this case

the corrupt central bank that printed

the money and distributed it back

to

the people

with blockchain

code is law that means whatever has been

written in that code if we had written

that every year there's only two percent

inflation max

then that is exactly what will happen

again blockchain is freedom

the other day i spoke to a friend of

mine about organizing a kite surfing

trip because we're both

passionate kite surfers

it was much to my surprise that in the

following days i was inundated by

advertisements about kite surfing on all

kinds of different platforms on facebook

on instagram on amazon on google

everywhere

it seemed that some someone was

listening in on our conversations

and then i realized data we produce is

no longer ours

the things we say the things we write

the websites we use the things we like

all of that

now belongs to the big tech corporations

they own our data and they own us

we have become

the product

what if there was a way to

re-appropriate the ownership of that

data how can we get that data back

again blockchain can help us

with blockchain we take that control

we eliminate the intermediary in this

case the big tech companies

and give ourselves control over our data

again then we can decide who we share

our data with and what we want to do

with it

again blockchain is about freedom

many times people ask me why i decided

to move into the blockchain industry

and indeed since 2014 that is a when i

first came across the subject since then

i've been fascinated by it

and sometime later i decided to

leave my well-paying job in investment

banking to pursue my passion full-time

it was the first time i really

experienced purpose

and that is my advice to you always

follow

purpose

don't

be tempted by short-term financial gain

don't let them lure you

don't let them buy you

also don't be that guy

instead

follow your passion and that doesn't

have to be blockchain

it could be any field and i'm sure you

will find that field for you eventually

but until then

if somebody asks you oh blockchain

that's about crypto and bitcoin right

tell them no blockchain is freedom

thank you
