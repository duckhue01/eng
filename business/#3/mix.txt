When we use the word “value,” we’re
usually trying to describe something’s gia tri,

importance, or huu ich to us.

I value your opinion.

That’s nice.

That hat seems like a great value for the
price.

Cha-ching!

talked over the professor the whole time.

Rude.

And when it comes to entrepreneurship, value
is everything.

Value is the core of any business, and it
directs all future decisions, innovations,

and customers that get targeted.
=======================================
Even if we’ve thought about the big picture,
if we can’t explain how an idea makes someone’s

life better, then tai sao moi nguoi phai chu  y?

So let’s talk strategies to answer the two
fundamental questions at the core of any business

model: “What value do I deliver?” and
“Who are my customers?”

I’m Anna Akana, and this is Crash Course
Business: Entrepreneurship.

doi khi biet ngu kinh doanh co the co ve kho hieu,
but here’s the trick: the words usually

have pretty nghia den.

Since value means worth, a Value Proposition
is gia tri ban cung cap cho khach hang cua ban.
=======================================
Typically, a value proposition is a sentence
or paragraph that trinh bay ro rang what

your service, business, or organization does,
who it brings value to, and why it’s valuable

for those people.

It should be clear why someone should choose
your company over the competition.

products at a lower price or higher quality,

For example, Slack is a messaging app designed
to reduce email and hop li hoa giao tiep nhom

-- or, in their words, “make work life simpler,

work we’ve done to develop our ideas.
===================================
Anna 1: So… what are you worth?

Anna 2: Excuse me?

Anna 1: What are you worth?

What’s your value?

Why should people care about you and your
work?

Anna 2: Uh, I guess...

I tell stories with my art that help people
find meaning and feel less alone… but also,

how do you even judge the value of a movie
or a song or YouTube video or ANY art, you

know???
===========================================
When we write a value proposition, we have
to think about two main things: first, the

experiences of our customers

and second, the capabilities of our product
or service.

If we’ve got those down, it’ll basically
write itself!

To make sure we’re covering our bases, we
can use the Value Proposition Canvas created

by a company called Strategyzer.

Half of the work is understanding customers.

Gotta catch ‘em all!

And to do that, there are 3 main questions
to ask:
===============================================
Number 1: What are their jobs?

And this is a little confusing, but I don’t
mean their literal jobs.

More like… what do they do at work and in
everyday life, and what problems do they have?

Number 2: What pains do they experience, like
risks, tro ngai, or bad outcomes?

And number 3: nhung loi ich tich cuc nao ma ho dang tim kiem va 
nhan duoc?

Everyone is trying to maximize gains and minimize
pains, or at least dat duoc su can bang lanh manh.

After considering the customer experience,

==========================================
Number 1: What products and services are we
offering customers to help them complete jobs?

Number 2: Is what we’re offering a pain
reliever that cuts out risks, obstacles, and

bad outcomes?

And number 3: Better yet, is what we’re
offering a gain creator?

Together, customers and products help us define
our value!

So let’s get down to the nitty-gritty details
of writing a value proposition, shall we?

In order to figure out the jobs, pains, and
gains of our customers, we have to find them

and to mo ve cuoc song cua ho

But keep it professional -- this is entrepreneurship!

=====================================================
Some might call this research finding your
target market, nhung nguoi co nhieu kha nang

There are lots of ways to connect with khach hang tiem nang

Remember, the goal is to learn from potential
customers to turn your idea into a giai phap hang dau 
cho mot van de,

whether you’re working on spill-proof takeout
containers or more affordable childcare.

So sleuth out the Who, What, Where, When,
Why, and How of your target market.
================================================
Who do you think or know is experiencing the
problem?

How old are they, do they have a family, or
do they speak different languages?

Are they a cat?

Please say they’re a cat.

I understand them.

What are they doing when they experience the
problem?

Are they working at a desk job, crafting something,
or exercising?

Maybe they’re hiding under a blanket away
from the world and their problems until they

crumble into dust.

Where are they experiencing the problem?
==========================================
Are they at work or at home?

On a plane?

A train?

An automobile?

When are they experiencing the problem?

Is there a time of day, week, or year?

Is it a van de thoi vu?

Maybe it changes with the phase of moon and
the flow of the tides -- we can’t help it

when Mercury’s in retrograde. Take it from a Leo.

Why are they experiencing the problem?

Why are others not experiencing the problem?

And, like, why me?
===================================================
Why is it always me???

And, finally, nhung nguoi khac nhau trai qua van de
khac nhau nhu nao?

lam the nao ho hoc cach doi pho voi van de hoac phat trien
giai phap rieng cua ho?

I mean, ignoring the problem is an option.

But, uh, not always the best way to cope.

Says my therapist.

All these questions paint a picture of who
we’re dealing with, and give us a peek at

their jobs.

And when we’re dealing with value propositions,
customer jobs can be functional, social, or

emotional.
=============================================
Functional jobs are what thuong cong nhan
 as work that pays the bills.

A big mistake when writing a value proposition
is only focusing on the functional jobs of

our customers.

But customers feel nghia vu xa hoi to look
good or support their community.

And nhung cong viec tinh cam la tat ca cong viec
chung ta bo ra de phat trien nhu con nguoi.

The ultimate goal of understanding customer
jobs is to get into their heads.

or what they’d like to value.

Entrepreneurs want to change the status quo.
==========================================
vi vay new chung ta biet nhung gi khach hang danh gia cao, we can
figure out lam the nao de mang lai cho ho nhung gi ho muon

in a new or better format.

Remember the point of the value proposition:
why should people choose you over everyone

else?

su gian doan is one strategy to give customers
value, and it’s a hot business vocab word.

Instead of challenging existing markets and
trying to make our idea stand out in a field

of others, why not create a new market (often
called a blue ocean) so our idea is like a

seed nay mam a whole new garden?
==============================================
Here, we’re not talking about value that
comes from lower prices or faster delivery

-- we’re talking about cho phep khach hang
dat duoc nhung cong viec tuong tu nhung
o mot dinh dang hoan toan moi.

nhu ngay xua, radio was the cream
of the crop for media in everyone’s home.

Radio listeners had two needs: one, to be
entertained, and two, to duoc cap nhat thong tin.

And radio met those needs by broadcasting
different programs, from music to dramatic

theater to news.

Then, along came television -- mot dinh doang truyen thong

people.
=================================================
Because TV achieved similar customer needs
in a fresh way, TV entrepreneurs khong phai
canh tranh trong the gioi dai phat thanh.

They built their own world, created new value,
and maybe even found new customers who weren’t

interested in radio at all.

Of course, we know jobs don’t come without pains.

We’re all human.

The struggle is real.

So when we think about our customers, we need
to consider nhung rui ro hoac kho chiu nao dang can tro ho.

neu chung ta co the giai quyet nhung noi dau do, that means
we’ll create a better business with more value.
===============================
If a customer’s job is applying to college,
some pains could be: the trang web tuyen sinh
kho hieu from 2002, application fees and tuition
costs,

a lack of family support, or the trade-off
between working to earn money now and tieu tien
for another degree.

And customers wouldn’t do jobs at all without
gains, which tell us what they need or want

to experience before or after a job.

Sticking with that college application example,
the gains might be: trien vong nghe nghiep tot hon,

a higher salary after graduation, tiep suc voi nhung suy 
nghi va y tuong moi, a fresh start,

or new friends.
==============================================
Now how are you going to help them - product

Now that we’ve researched our potential
customers, we’ve filled out half of our

Value Proposition Canvas.

Or you can sort all that knowledge with one
of those nhung buc tuong dieu tra am muu with

You do you.

It’s your value proposition.

Using all this info, chung ta co the cat tai

and services are thuc su lam giam bot loi dau,
creating gains, and adding value to people’s

=============================================
Once we’ve done this, our value proposition

To see how, let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

Stitch Fix is a personal styling service that
gui quan ao va phu kien cho moi nguoi.

It has customers all across the U.S. and soon
across the U.K.

Those customers have many jobs to do, but
an obvious one is to shop for clothes.

Let’s think of Stitch Fix customers as busy,
nhung nguoi hieu biet ve cong nghe co tuoi 25-50 living

in the U.S., of all genders, and working across
all fields.

And ho luon san sang chi mot so tien cho thoi trang.
================================================
They might be pained by lots of things, like
no time as they try to juggle work and family,

stores, or having no idea what their “body

type” is.

Pear?

Apple?

...Pineapple?

After exploring their target market, Stitch

for convenience, nhung goi khac nhau cho cac

doorstep delivery, an easy return system,
and tu quan ao thiet ke theo cao nhan for different

body types.
=============================================
Now, these customers might shop for clothes
because they want gains of looking good and

feeling confident in and out of the workplace.

So Stitch Fix wants to deliver that gain.

But they also create new gains using technology,
like nhung khao sat cua ho ve do luong va so thich,

algorithms,

and personal stylists to help their customers
feel good about the clothes they get and save

=============================================
Combining all this information, Stitch Fix

“We save our clients time by doing the shopping.”

If we were to get a little more detailed for
them, we might say, “Stitch Fix tan dung cong nghe

using personalized measurements, so thich,

and stylists to shop for clothes, duoc giao

Thanks, Thought Bubble!

After all this thinking and research, our
value proposition is done.

So when you’re asked “What are you worth?”,

=============================================

feel less alone and lam noi bat su phuc tap

Also cats.

Today, we learned about value and how customer-driven
thinking can help us the hien what our business

has to offer.

By understanding customer jobs, pains, and
gains, we can make sure our products and services

giam bot noi dau va tao ra loi nhuan
===============================================
And then -- boom -- we have a value proposition,
a statement basically saying why we’re better

than anybody else.

Next time, we’ll target the competition.

Well, not target them like in target practice.

But we will talk about how to figure out who
you’re competing with in this entrepreneurship

arena, and what can be learned from observing
them.
